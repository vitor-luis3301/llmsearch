# LLM Search
A simple project that aims to test the Langchain python library as well as the **DuckDuckGo Search Results** tool.

It uses **Ollama** as default LLM vendor. To change the Ollama model, change the `DEFAULT_MODEL` variable in the .env file

If you wish to use something other than Ollama, manual changes are required, idgaf.
